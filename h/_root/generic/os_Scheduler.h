/*!run_scheduler
 * ***********************************************************************************************
 * Description:
 * [run_scheduler] is a global flag, which enables a CPU reset from any part of the firmware.
 * This is meant to be used as "main fuse" in case something is badly going out of control 
 * and the CPU has to be restarted in a deterministic way.
 * 
 * When [run_main_loop] is set to zero, the scheduler will complete the execution of the most 
 * recent task end exit the main while() loop, where a CPU_RESET instruction will reset the CPU,
 * effectively causing a system restart.
 * 
 * If an immediate restart is necessary, use the CPU_RESET macro directly.
 * 
 * See also:
 * CPU_RESET

/*!CPU_LOAD_DEBUG_BUFFER_LENGTH
 * ***********************************************************************************************
 * Description:
 * CPU load and task execution time monitoring can be enabled internally during debug mode
 * by setting this option =1.
 * 
 * When enabled, two data arrays are used to log most recent CPU meter and task execution time
 * meter results. This function collects data continuously by filling the arrays from index 0
 * to n, rolls over and continues to add data from index 0. A software breakpoint needs to be 
 * placed to stop code execution and inspect the collected data arrays.
 * 
 * CPU_LOAD_DEBUG_BUFFER_LENGTH determines the length of the data arrays.
 * 
 * See also:
 * CPU_LOAD_DEBUG_BUFFER_LENGTH
