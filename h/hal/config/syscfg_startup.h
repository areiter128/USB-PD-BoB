/*!Startup Behavior
 * *************************************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * Global defines for soft-start specific parameters
 * 
 * Description:
 * This section is used to define power supply startup timing setting. The soft-start sequence 
 * is part of the power controller. It allows to program specific timings for Power On Delay,
 * Ramp Period and Power Good Delay. After the startup has passed these three timing periods,
 * the power supply is ending up in "normal" operation, continuously regulating the output until 
 * a fault is detected or the operating state is changed for any other reason.
 * 
 * Pre-compiler macros are used to translate physical values into binary (integer) numbers to 
 * be written to SFRs and variables.
