 * Summary:
 * Globally defines the APPLICATION_t data structure
 *
 * Description:	
 * Most applications require a certain set of high-level information to set basic 
 * parameters for internal tasks and functions as well as status information. These 
 * parameters are consolidated in the APPLICATION_t data structure, which 
 * is 100% user defined. The status, settings and data broadcast data structures
 * added to the APPLICITON_t data structure should be considered as template only 
 * and can be edited and modified as necessary. 
 * 
 * This file is shared between master and slave project to keep the application status 
 * information in synchronization.

/*!APPLICATION_STATUS_t
 *****************************************************************************
 * 
 * Summary:
 * Common and specific application-level status flags
 *
 * Description:	
 * This data structure provides status flag bits specifying most recent results
 * of the fault handler and other sections of the user firmware.
 * 
 * Bit <15> is reserved for a global fault flag bit indicating that any fault
 * condition of the level NOTICE, WARNING or FAULT has been detected. These flag
 * bit is an unspecific indication on global level only.
 * 
 * Specific information about which part of the firmware has detected a fault 
 * condition, if there is only one or more fault conditions of the same type pending
 * and additional information about root cause and significance of every single one
 * of them is stored in the individual FAULT_OBJECT of the fault handler.
 *
 * APPLICATION_FAULT_STATUS_BIT_FIELD_t defines individual status flag bits, 
 * which can directly be addressed (set and cleared by software individually)
 * 
 * APPLICATION_FAULT_STATUS_FLAGS_t merges the single-bit data structure into 
 * an unsigned 16-bit value to also allow to apply bit masks or ease the process of 
 * resetting the entire data structure.
 * 
 * APPLICATION_STATUS_t is the data structure, which holds the status flag bits 
 * and other parameters about the most recent status of the application.
 *
