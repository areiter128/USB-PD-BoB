 *
 * Description:
 * This code example has been created to introduce the functionality of the
 * basic SMPS firmware framework v4. This project uses the basic function call
 * based scheduler to group, align and monitor user tasks. 
 * 
 * The procedure shown in this examples initializes the internal oscillator and 
 * the task scheduler and then immediately launches the scheduler. During the 
 * start-up phase of the controller, configuration of peripherals are also 
 * executed within the active scheduler monitoring & control scheme to be able
 * to respond to errors during the configuration process. This specific aspect
 * is only available if peripheral libraries are used. 
 * If MCC is used to set up the peripherals, the function call SYSTEM_Initialize()
 * will call the MCC generated configuration instead and the operating mode 
 * OP_MODE_BOOT used in this example project needs to be bypassed.
 *

     * Description:
     * The main task scheduler engine is called as a single and sole
     * function call placed here in main() of the user project.
     * From this point forward the code will be executed within the 
     * task-scheduler main loop. when this loop is terminated due to
     * a device restart (e.g. triggered by a catastrophic fault event),
     * the code will return to main().
     * 
     * Users can place additional startup or exit code as needed.
     * However, fundamental device configurations like oscillator 
     * of peripheral initialization will only take place within the
     * main task scheduler execution.
