 * ************************************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * Initializes the oscillator and task scheduler timer
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * (none)
 * 
 * Returns:
 * 0 = FALSE
 * 1 = TRUE
 * 
 * Description:
 * Initializes the main oscillator, the auxiliary oscillator and task scheduler timer peripheral.
 * All other, application specific peripheral configurations are executed within the scheduler 
 * where they can be monitored and faults can be detected and handled directly.
 * 
 * Please Note:
 * In case users would like to use MCC to generate code for device peripheral configurations, 
 * the function call CLOCK_Initialize() will directly call the MCC generated code modules instead
 * of the peripheral libraries used in this example.

 * Summary:
 * Initializes the task scheduler.

 * 
 * Description:
 * Initializes the task scheduler and sets it up for the boot phase during which the functional 
 * peripheral blocks will be initialized and the system reaches full functionality.
 * 
 * Please Note:
 * In case users would like to use MCC to generate code for device peripheral configurations,

 * of the peripheral libraries used in this example. 
 * If you use MCC all peripheral modules will be configured by SYSTEM_Initialize(). We recommend,
 * however, to initialize all modules used in a disabled state and use individual tasks to enable
 * functions when they are needed, resp. when their startup timing and execution can be monitored 
 * by the scheduler.

/*!DEVICE_Reset()
 * ************************************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * Resets GPIOs and peripheral blocks to a defined default state
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * (none)
 * 
 * Returns:
 * 0 = FALSE
 * 1 = TRUE
 * 
 * Description:
 * PICmicro controllers have analog pins set to ANALOG function and all peripherals powered
 * when the device comes out RESET. This may not be desired for many designs. Therefore the
 * GPIOs are reset to DIGITAL function and the power to all peripheral modules is turned off 
 * using the PMDx registers by default.
 * 
 * Please Note:
 * In case users would like to use MCC to generate code for device peripheral configurations, 
 * the function call SYSTEM_initialize() will directly call the MCC generated code modules instead
 * of the peripheral libraries used in this example. As of today, MCC does not cover PMD registers 
 * the function DEVICE_Reset() will cause configurations of peripheral functions of un-powered 
 * peripherals to fail.
