 *
 * Summary:
 * Highly application and hardware specific user startup-code extension
 *
 * Description:	
 * Some designs require immediate actions after device reset like fast recovery
 * after power brown-out or to set a state of a certain, external peripheral circuit
 * such as an auxiliary power supply, before any other function can be enabled.
 * 
 * This code module will be called right after the DEVICE_Reset function call and only
 * if the user option EXECUTE_USER_STARTUP_CODE in the header file apl.h is set to 1 
 *

     * When the task manager setting EXECUTE_USER_STARTUP_CODE is set to 1, this
     * function will be called right after the device is coming out of RESET and
     * the function DEVOCE_Reset has been executed.
     * 
     * PLEASE NOTE:
     * ============
     * This special feature of the task scheduler should only be used when critical,
     * low-level procedures need to be performed when the system gets powered up.
     * If no special action needs to be taken at startup, it's recommended to 
     * disable this feature by setting (EXECUTE_USER_STARTUP_CODE = 0). 
     * 
     * All conventional startup code should be incorporated into the task scheduler 
     * task queues.
